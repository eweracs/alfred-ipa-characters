## Typefacts IPA Characters Workflow for Alfred 3

Typing IPA symbols on a regular keyboard is virtually impossible. Instead of using digital online keyboards, this workflow allows searching for phonemes by their articulatory description and will insert them from the clipboard into the frontmost application.

This workflow is based on the [Special Characters](http://typefacts.com/news/special-characters-an-alfred-app-workflow) workflow by Typefacts.

## Compiling
```bash
py build-workflow.py -f -o . src/
```
You may need to install the Python dependencies via `pip`.
